<br><br>
          2.  PROMOTIONAL PERIOD: On each day, from November 27, 2017 to December 23, 2017, the Promoter shall enter eligible consumers (“Participants”) into a daily drawing for the prize specified below (“Prize”) through whatever legal means and in whatever legal manner chosen by the Promoter in its sole discretion, such that said Participants may enter the Sweepstakes for a chance to win the Prize. Only One (1) Grand Prize is available to be won, and the Sweepstakes will terminate when a winner has been selected.

In the event the telephone number used to participate belongs to someone other than the registered Participant, the entry will be invalid and any prize won will be forfeited.
<br><br>
          Upon commencement of the Survey, the Participant will be entered into the pool of potential winners for that day’s prize drawing. Drawings will be conducted on or before 12:00 a.m. CST on each day during the Promotional Period. The cut-off time for submitting an entry is 2:00 p.m. CST.

At the drawing, each Participant will be assigned a unique entry number (“Entry Number”) that will be matched against a randomly selected winning number. If a Participant’s Entry Number matches the winning number, the Participant is a potential winner of the Prize, subject to proof of eligibility. Potential winners will be contacted by the Promoter via telephone and/or e-mail. In the event the Promoter is unable to contact a potential winner after reasonable efforts to do so, or if a potential winner fails to confirm his or her eligibility to win the Prize, the Promoter reserves the right to disqualify the potential winner.

          11.  GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:
<br><br>
          Scope of Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver. By entering or participating in the Sweepstakes, you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise out of or relate to the Sweepstakes, except as otherwise set forth herein. Therefore, you agree that, by entering or participating in the Sweepstakes, both you and the Promoter are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other entrants or Participants, or other persons similarly situated.
<br><br>
          This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to claims arising out of or relating to the Sweepstakes, these Official Rules, the Promoter’s website, and telemarketing or other marketing activities conducted by Promoter or on Promoter’s behalf, and any other claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of your participation in the Sweepstakes, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, regardless of whether they arise before or after conclusion of the Sweepstakes.
<br><br>
          Arbitration Procedure. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written demand (“Demand”). The Demand must: (1) describe reasonably the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. If Promoter and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Demand within 30 days after the Demand is received, Promoter or you may commence an arbitration proceeding.
<br><br>
          The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Official Rules, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to Promoter at the address above. The arbitration shall take place in Jackson County, Missouri. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Official Rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision, which are for a court of law to decide.
<br><br>
          Unless both Promoter and you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case, except to enforce the award. You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees).
<br><br>
          One Year Limitation on Actions. YOU MUST FILE A DEMAND WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH DEMAND, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY DEMAND BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS, OR DISPUTE.
<br><br>
          Survival of Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver. This section will survive the conclusion or termination of the Sweepstakes.
<br><br>
          Governing Law. All issues concerning the construction, validity and enforcement of these Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of the parties, shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to conflicts of law rules.
<br><br>
          12.  PRIVACY POLICY. Information submitted with an entry is subject to the Promoter’s Privacy Policy stated on the Promoter’s website. In those instances in which registration in the Sweepstakes occurs through a website operated by a third party, entrants will be subject to policies of such websites.
