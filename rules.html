        <h2>OFFICIAL RULES</h2>

        <h3>NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.</h3>

        <p>Void where prohibited by law. Subject to all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.</p>

        <p>By entering into this Instant Win Game, you agree to and accept the terms of these Official Rules.</p>

        <p><strong>PROMOTION DESCRIPTION:</strong> Forte Media Instant Win Game (the “Instant Win”) consists of various different promotions and creative displays wherein eligible entrants will have the opportunity to participate for a chance to win the prize associated with the specific promotion, as described herein. By participating in the Instant Win, each entrant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules and the decisions of Forte Media (“Sponsor”), which shall be final and binding in all respects. This Instant Win is in no way sponsored, endorsed, or administered by, or associated with Facebook.</p>

        <p><strong>ENTRY PERIOD:</strong> The Instant Win begins on 5/8/2018 12:00:01 a.m. PST and ends on 5/9/2019 at 11:59:59 p.m. PST, or when all prizes have been awarded (the “Instant Win Period”).</p>

        <p><strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong> Open only to legal U.S. residents who reside in the fifty (50) United States and Washington, D.C. who are at least eighteen (18) years of age and at least the age of majority in their state of primary residence at the time of entry. Employees, contractors, officers and directors of Sponsor, SCA Promotions, Inc. (the “Administrator”), and each of their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, retailers, sales representatives, contractors, consultants, legal counsel, web providers, web masters, advertising and promotion agencies (collectively, the “Promotion Entities”) and the immediate family members (spouses, parents, siblings, and children, regardless of where they live), and/or those living in the same household of each, are ineligible to participate in the Instant Win or win a prize. This Instant Win is subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances and is void where prohibited by law.</p>

        <p><strong>ENTRY PROCESS AND WINNER NOTIFICATION:</strong> During the Instant Win Period, eligible entrants will be invited to participate in the Instant Win via a banner or creative presentation (the “Invitation”) shown when the entrant visits websites where Sponsor has purchased advertising space. To enter, entrant must click on the Invitation that will bring entrant to the https://win.rewardsadvisor.com/a/RWRD01 registration path (the “Website”), complete the registration form with the information requested, and complete a brief survey. Once the survey is completed and submitted, the entrant will have an opportunity to participate in the specific Instant Win for which he/she received an Invitation. Upon participation, entrant will immediately be informed whether he/she has won a prize, subject to verification of eligibility. If you receive a message that contains any message other than a winning prize message, you are not a winner. Personal information collected in connection with this Instant Win will be used in accordance with the privacy policy found at https://win.rewardsadvisor.com/privacy as well as the additional uses contemplated in these Official Rules. Limit: Each person may only enter the Instant Win one (1) time per Invitation during the Instant Win Period.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Participation must be by the entrant and only as directed in these Official Rules. Participation by any other individual or any entity, and/or originating at any other website or e-mail address, including but not limited to commercial promotion subscription notification and/or entering service sites, will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Instant Win. The use of any device to automate the entry process is prohibited and will lead to disqualification. Multiple participants are not permitted to share the same email address. Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of plays and/or entries by using multiple and/or different identities, forms, registrations, email addresses, logins or any other methods will void that participant's plays and/or entries, and that participant may be disqualified at Sponsor's and/or Administrator's discretion. Sponsor is not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, invalid, unintelligible or misdirected registrations, which will be disqualified. In the event of a dispute over the identity of an entrant, participation will be deemed completed by the authorized account holder of the email address provided at time of registration. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an email address by an Internet access provider, on-line service provider, wireless carrier, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Entries specifying an invalid, non-working, or inactive email address will be disqualified and ineligible to win.</p>

        <p>The Promotion Entities shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Instant Win or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of the entries in the Instant Win. The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries. Proof of sending or submission of Entry will not be deemed proof of receipt by Sponsor and/or Administrator. Sponsor's failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.</p>

        <p><strong>WINNER SELECTION:</strong> There are three (3) Instant Win Games for which an entrant is eligible to win. Prior to the start of the Instant Win, Administrator will randomly determine one (1) prize determination number (the “Prize Determination Number”) per Instant Win Game for the Instant Win. At the time of your participation in the Instant Win, the Administrator's computer will randomly generate one (1) number associated with your game play per Instant Win Game (the “Participant Number”) for the applicable Instant Win. If the Prize Determination Number associated with the Instant Win in which you are participating and your Participant Number match identically, you will be a potential winner of the applicable Prize for that Instant Win, subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules.</p>

        <p>ALL POTENTIAL WINNING PLAYS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY ADMINISTRATOR, WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING. A “SCREEN SHOT” IS NOT PROOF OR EVIDENCE OF A WINNING GAME PLAY AND/OR PRIZE. AN ENTRANT IS NOT A WINNER OF ANY PRIZE, EVEN IF THE WEBSITE AND/OR FACEBOOK APPLICATION SHOULD SO INDICATE, UNLESS AND UNTIL SAID ENTRANT'S ELIGIBILITY AND THE POTENTIAL WINNING PLAY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND SAID ENTRANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE. ADMINISTRATOR WILL NOT ACCEPT SCREEN SHOTS OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF WINNING IN LIEU OF ITS VALIDATION PROCESS. ANY PLAY THAT OCCURS AFTER THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED FOR ANY REASON IS DEEMED A DEFECTIVE PLAY AND IS VOID AND WILL NOT BE HONORED.</p>

        <p><strong>WINNER VERIFICATION:</strong> If you receive a notification that you are a potential winner, Sponsor will send an email with instructions on how to claim your prize to the email address you used during registration. Follow the instructions in the email to claim your prize. Any potential prize winner will be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing such condition is legal) a Publicity Release (collectively, “Prize Claim Documents”). If a potential winner cannot be notified, fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize Claim Documents within five (5) days of prize notification, or is disqualified for any reason, that potential winner may be disqualified and, at the discretion of the Sponsor the Prize will either not be awarded or a new Prize Determination Number will be selected and the Instant Win will continue. THE NUMBER OF PRIZES AVAILABLE WILL DIMINISH AS THEY ARE AWARDED. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY PRIZE WILL BE AWARDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INSTANT WIN.</p>

Prizes cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion or offer. If due to printing, production or other errors, more prizes are claimed than intended, the intended prize will be awarded in a random drawing from all those submitting purportedly valid claims. No more than the number of prizes set forth in these Official Rules will be awarded. Limit one (1) prize per person and per household.</p>

        <p><strong>PUBLICITY; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND RELEASES:</strong> Acceptance of a Prize constitutes Prize Winner's permission for Sponsor and its designees to use Prize Winner's name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation. Entrants agree that the Promotion Entities, Facebook, Inc., and their respective parent companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, representatives, consultants, contractors, legal counsel, advertising, public relations, promotional, fulfillment and marketing, website providers, web masters, and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, and agents (the “Released Parties”) shall not be responsible or liable for, and are hereby released from, any and all costs, injuries, losses or damages of any kind, including, without limitation, death and bodily injury, save for death or personal injury caused by negligence of any of the Promotion Entities due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to participation in the Instant Win or any Promotion-related activity, or from entrants' acceptance, receipt, possession and/or use or misuse of any prize. Entrants also agree that the Instant Win Entities have not made any warranty, representation or guarantee express or implied, in fact or in law, with respect to any prize, including, without limitation, to such prize's quality or fitness for a particular purpose. Sponsor assumes no responsibility for any damage to an entrant's or any other person's computer system or wireless phone which is occasioned by participating in the Instant Win, or for any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or other errors, failures, delayed computer transmissions or network connections that are human or technical in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete, illegible, misdirected, misprinted, late, lost, or damaged entries or prize notifications; or for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks, servers, satellites, Internet service providers, websites, or other connections; or for miscommunications, failed, jumbled, scrambled, delayed, or misdirected computer, telephone or cable transmissions; or for any technical malfunctions, failures, difficulties or other errors of any kind or nature; or for the incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to capture any information. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Instant Win, to be acting in violation of these Official Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Instant Win, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Instant Win if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Instant Win is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor's control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Instant Win as contemplated herein. In the event Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Instant Win as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Instant Win. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written document issued by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.</p>

        <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION:</strong> ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE INSTANT WIN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE'S LAWS.
