        <h1>Santa’s Daily Jackpot Privacy Policy</h1>


        <p>Last updated: November 14, 2017

        THIS IS A CONTRACT. YOU SHOULD READ IT.
<br><br>
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) (including any document incorporated by reference herein) governs how we collect and use the information you provide to us, and your participation in any promotions we sponsor. This Policy constitutes a legal contract between you and our company, and covers all aspects of your use of our website(s). BY REGISTERING ON OUR SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS POLICY. IF AT ANY TIME YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CEASE PARTICIPATING IN OUR SWEEPSTAKES AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.
<br><br>
        PRIVACY SUMMARY: The provisions of this Policy relating to the privacy of your personal information are set forth in Sections 3, 4, and 5. We recognize that the manner in which we use the personal information we collect on our registration forms (i.e., name, address, phone number, email, etc.) may be important to you. Although we encourage you to read this Policy in its entirety, here is a brief summary of how we use that information.
<br><br>
        We use the information you provide us to contact you. Our primary means of contact is via telephone. We need an accurate phone number to contact winners of our sweepstakes and contests, but we call everyone who registers on our site to conduct surveys and introduce them to products and services that may interest them. By providing us with your telephone number, you are expressly representing that you are the owner of such number and you are consenting to be called by us using our automated telephone dialing system or to receive texts from us, at the number you provide even if the number is a wireless number and even if the number is registered on the national Do Not Call List, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of any specific institution.
<br><br>
        You can revoke that permission at any time by telling us you no longer want to be called, but if you do not want to be called at all, do not register on our site. It’s that simple. You can still participate in our sweepstakes by following the instructions set forth in the official rules.
<br><br>
        1. Introduction/Eligibility. Any contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions offered through this website are not available to persons under the age of 18 or to persons who are not legal residents of the United States. BY CLICKING ANY “SUBMIT” OR OTHER BUTTON OR BY ACCESSING, BROWSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE WEBSITE YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE AND ARE A LEGAL RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Some of the promotions, products, and services offered through this site are offered by or through third parties, and will be subject to additional terms and conditions as required by those parties. To the extent not inconsistent with this Policy, these additional terms and conditions are incorporated herein by reference; however, in the case of any inconsistency between this Policy and any other document that is incorporated by reference herein, this Policy shall control.
<br><br>
        2. Information We Collect: We collect two basic types of information:
<br><br>
        – Personally Identifiable Information (PII): PII is information that personally identifies one individual from another (name, address, phone number, email address, etc.). You voluntarily provide us with PII when you complete an online form to participate in one of our sweepstakes or other promotions. PII is used by us in a number of ways, as further detailed below. We only collect PII that you voluntarily provide to us, and only ask for it when you register to participate in our sweepstakes and other promotions.
<br><br>
        – General Information: General Information consists of generalized web usage data that does not distinguish one person from another. An example of this is information pertaining to which search engine was used by visitors to locate our site, and other aggregate user and tracking information, cookies, log analysis software, and other tracking technologies. This information is anonymous in nature and does not contain any PII. It tells us how visitors use our site, and we use it ensure that our website, e-mails and marketing efforts continue to appeal to our subscribers. We use General Information for our own internal purposes, and do not share it with third parties, unless they are contracted to provide us with certain services (i.e., statistical analysis).
<br><br>
        3. How we use PII. We use the PII you submit online to process your entry into sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion you requested, and to contact you. By providing us with your contact information, you are expressly consenting to be contacted by us or by one or more marketing partners, either by telephone, email or postal mail. THIS PART IS IMPORTANT: We call everyone who registers on our site to conduct surveys and introduce them to products and services that may be of interest to them. By providing us with your telephone number, you are expressly consenting to be contacted by us or by one or more marketing partners using automated telephone dialing systems, either by telephone (voice and/or text), email or postal mail even if you have opted into the national Do Not Call List, any state equivalent Do Not Call List or the Do Not Call List of any specific institution.
<br><br>
        You can still participate in our sweepstakes by following the instructions set forth in the official rules.
<br><br>
        Here is some more information about how we use the specific elements of PII that we ask you to provide:
<br><br>
        – Name: We ask for your name to properly identify you (i.e., to match your name with the telephone number and other information you provided to us) and to communicate with you on a personal level. We also attempt to match your name with other information you provide to us in order to confirm your identity.
<br><br>
        – Telephone Number: We ask for your telephone number to process your entry into any sweepstakes or other promotions that we may run from time to time, and to call you with relevant offers. If the number you provide us with is a mobile phone number, we will contact you on that number, either by voice call or text, using our automated telephone dialing system. We may call you more than once to offer additional products that we believe may be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of these calls by adding your name to our internal do-not-call list.
<br><br>
        – E-mail Address: We ask for an e-mail address so that we may contact you via e-mail. We may send you offers to participate in sweepstakes and promotions, and information about products or services that may be of interest to you. We typically share e-mail address information with third parties; therefore, you may also receive newsletters and offers from our sponsors, affiliates and marketing partners at this e-mail address. These mailings contain clear information on how to unsubscribe, and we honor all requests as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
        – Mailing Address: We ask for a mailing address to validate your identity, and so we know where to ship any prize you may win. We may also mail you offers to participate in sweepstakes and other promotions.
<br><br>
        – Lifestyle Information: Although you do not have to purchase anything to participate in our sweepstakes, we may require you to answer a series of lifestyle questions. We may ask these questions online, or over the telephone. We use the answers you provide to present you with product offers that are relevant to your lifestyle. You are under no obligation to accept any of these offers.
<br><br>
        – Other Ways We Use Information. In addition to the specific uses set forth above, we may also use your information (including PII), for various business purposes including, without limitation, the following: (i) to improve the quality of your visit; (ii) to confirm and manage your registration; (iii) to provide written proof to any regulatory authority that you registered on our website and provided us with consent to contact you; (iv) to provide reports to offer sponsors and affiliates; (v) to improve our site and the visitor’s experience through customization, analysis, and adjustments; and (vi) to enforce our agreements with you, prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities, and for other legally permissible purposes.
<br><br>
        In addition, we sometimes contract with third parties to perform functions or services on our behalf, such as hosting the website, sending email messages, and administering contests, surveys and other promotions. We necessarily have to share your PII with such third parties as may be required to perform their functions.
<br><br>
        In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information, including PII, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your PII), would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used according to your PII as set forth in this policy.
<br><br>
        4. How We Share PII. By voluntarily providing us with your PII, you are giving us permission to share it with others in any manner we see fit. We may share your name, phone number, e-mail address, and physical address with third party marketing partners if you have expressed an interest in the products or services they provide, or for any other business purpose. We may also disclose PII as we deem necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce the terms of this Policy; or (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties.
<br><br>
        Specifically, we will share your information with Subscription Ink and its marketing partners and affiliates.
<br><br>
        5. How We Protect PII. Your PII is as important to us as it is to you. We appreciate your sharing it with us, and we will do everything in our power to protect it from unauthorized disclosure, and to keep you from regretting your decision to share it.
<br><br>
        – We will not abuse the permission you’ve given us to contact you. We will not call you very often, and when we do, our agents will be polite and respectful. If they are not, please let us know.
<br><br>
        – We will honor your request not to be called. All you need to do is ask, and we will put you on our internal Do-Not-Call list, and we will stop calling you. However, if you do ask not to be called, and afterwards enter another of our sweepstakes, you’re giving us permission to call you again. If you never want to get a call from us again, don’t enter any more sweepstakes.
<br><br>
        – We will protect your PII from unauthorized access. We employ industry accepted tools and techniques to protect your privacy and against unauthorized access to our systems. However, we have no control over the security of other web sites on the Internet that you might visit even when you visit those sites via a link on our site.
<br><br>
        6. Online Tracking Technology. We do not currently employ any technology that enables us to track your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites, nor do we currently permit third parties with whom we may share PII to do so. Keep in mind, however, that we have no control over the activities of third parties, and they may employ such technology regardless of whether we prohibit it. Because we do not employ tracking technology, we offer no response to Do Not Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.
<br><br>
        7. Waiver of Do-Not-Call and Class Action Rights. Your registration on this site and/or and entry into our Sweepstakes constitutes a waiver of any rights to bring a private lawsuit you may have under state or federal statutes and regulations, including (but not limited to) the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the actions of Denim Ventures, use of the site, entry into the sweepstakes or this Policy, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The place of arbitration shall be Jackson County, Missouri and Missouri law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
<br><br>
        You are agreeing to receive calls (by live operator or pre-recorded message) and/or texts initiated by an automated telephone dialing device, at the registered number regardless of whether such number is listed on any state or federal DNC Registry as of the date the entry form is submitted, and regardless of whether it is a cellular phone or land-line. You may opt out of receiving future calls at any time by asking to be placed on our internal Do-Not-Call list. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Santa’s Daily Jackpot will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.  BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND PARTICIPATING IN OUR SWEEPSTAKES, YOU ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE THROUGH A CLASS ACTION OR THROUGH ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
<br><br>
        8. For Residents of Certain States.
<br><br>
        – Special California Privacy Rights Notice (California Civil Code Section 1798.83): In addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, Residents of California (“California Subscribers”), generally have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of PII with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, California Subscribers may request from a business certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. California Users may request further information about our compliance with this law by sending us a written request to Santa’s Daily Jackpot Sweepstakes, c/o/ Denim Ventures, LLC, 1712 Main Street, 4th Floor, Kansas City, MO  64018. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year concerning this law, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the Contact Us link on the Site. In accordance with California law, we will not share information we collect about you with companies outside of our corporate family, except as permitted by law, including, for example, with your consent or to service your account. We will limit sharing among our companies to the extent required by California law.
<br><br>
        – For Vermont residents: In accordance with Vermont law, we will not share information we collect about you with companies outside of our corporate family, except as permitted by law, including, for example with your consent or to service your account. Note that you are consenting for us to share information by participating in our sweepstakes and other promotions, as we hope we’ve made clear. We will not share information about your creditworthiness within our corporate family except with your authorization or consent, but we may share information about our transactions or experiences with you within our corporate family without your consent.
<br><br>
        – For Nevada residents: We may contact our existing customers by telephone to offer additional products that we believe may be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of these calls by adding your name to our internal do-not-call list. To opt out of these calls, or for more information about your opt out rights, please contact our customer service department. In addition, Nevada residents can contact the Nevada Attorney General for more information regarding opt out rights by calling 775-684-1100, emailing bcpinfo@ag.state.nv.us, or by writing to: Office of the Attorney General, Nevada Department of Justice, Bureau of Consumer Protection 100 North Carson Street, Carson City, NV 89701-4717
